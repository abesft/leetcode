# [2100. Find Good Days to Rob the Bank](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-good-days-to-rob-the-bank/)

You and a gang of thieves are planning on robbing a bank. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `security`, where `security[i]` is the number of guards on duty on the `ith` day. The days are numbered starting from `0`. You are also given an integer `time`.

The `ith` day is a good day to rob the bank if:

- There are at least `time` days before and after the `ith` day,
- The number of guards at the bank for the `time` days **before** `i` are **non-increasing**, and
- The number of guards at the bank for the `time` days **after** `i` are **non-decreasing**.

More formally, this means day `i` is a good day to rob the bank if and only if `security[i - time] >= security[i - time + 1] >= ... >= security[i] <= ... <= security[i + time - 1] <= security[i + time]`.

Return *a list of **all** days **(0-indexed)** that are good days to rob the bank*. *The order that the days are returned in does **not** matter.*

**Example 1:**

```
Input: security = [5,3,3,3,5,6,2], time = 2
Output: [2,3]
Explanation:
On day 2, we have security[0] >= security[1] >= security[2] <= security[3] <= security[4].
On day 3, we have security[1] >= security[2] >= security[3] <= security[4] <= security[5].
No other days satisfy this condition, so days 2 and 3 are the only good days to rob the bank.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: security = [1,1,1,1,1], time = 0
Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
Since time equals 0, every day is a good day to rob the bank, so return every day.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: security = [1,2,3,4,5,6], time = 2
Output: []
Explanation:
No day has 2 days before it that have a non-increasing number of guards.
Thus, no day is a good day to rob the bank, so return an empty list.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= security.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= security[i], time <= 10^5`

**题目**：你和一群强盗准备打劫银行。给你一个下标从 **0** 开始的整数数组 `security` ，其中 `security[i]` 是第 `i` 天执勤警卫的数量。日子从 `0` 开始编号。同时给你一个整数 `time` 。如果第 `i` 天满足以下所有条件，我们称它为一个适合打劫银行的日子：第 `i` 天前和后都分别至少有 `time` 天。第 `i` 天前连续 `time` 天警卫数目都是非递增的。第 `i` 天后连续 `time` 天警卫数目都是非递减的。更正式的，第 `i` 天是一个合适打劫银行的日子当且仅当：`security[i - time] >= security[i - time + 1] >= ... >= security[i] <= ... <= security[i + time - 1] <= security[i + time]`.请你返回一个数组，包含 **所有** 适合打劫银行的日子（下标从 **0** 开始）。返回的日子可以 **任意** 顺序排列。
