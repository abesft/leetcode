# [162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.

**题目**：峰值元素是指其值严格大于左右相邻值的元素。给你一个整数数组 `nums`，找到峰值元素并返回其索引。数组可能包含多个峰值，在这种情况下，返回 **任何一个峰值** 所在位置即可。你可以假设 `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞` 。你必须实现时间复杂度为 `O(log n)` 的算法来解决此问题。

**思路**：参考[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/discuss/50232/Find-the-maximum-by-binary-search-(recursion-and-iteration))，852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array。无同值的相邻元素。

> Q: But I cannot understand how it works and why using binary searching on unsorted array is reasonable in this problem.
>
> A: Lets say you have a mid number at index x, nums[x]
> if (num[x+1] > nums[x]), that means a peak element HAS to exist on the right half of that array, because (since every number is unique) 1. the numbers keep increasing on the right side, and the peak will be the last element. 2. the numbers stop increasing and there is a 'dip', or there exists somewhere a number such that nums[y] < nums[y-1], which means number[x] is a peak element.
>
> This same logic can be applied to the left hand side (nums[x] < nums[x-1]).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        return helper(nums, 0, nums.size()-1);
    }
private:
    int helper(const vector<int>& nums, int lo, int hi){
        if(lo == hi)
            return lo;
        int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
        if(nums[mid] < nums[mid+1])
            return helper(nums, mid+1, hi);
        else
            return helper(nums, lo, mid);
    }
};
```
