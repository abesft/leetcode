# [2187. Minimum Time to Complete Trips](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-complete-trips/)

You are given an array `time` where `time[i]` denotes the time taken by the `ith` bus to complete **one trip**.

Each bus can make multiple trips **successively**; that is, the next trip can start **immediately after** completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates **independently**; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.

You are also given an integer `totalTrips`, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make **in total**. Return *the **minimum time** required for all buses to complete **at least*** `totalTrips` *trips*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: time = [1,2,3], totalTrips = 5
Output: 3
Explanation:
- At time t = 1, the number of trips completed by each bus are [1,0,0].
  The total number of trips completed is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
- At time t = 2, the number of trips completed by each bus are [2,1,0].
  The total number of trips completed is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.
- At time t = 3, the number of trips completed by each bus are [3,1,1].
  The total number of trips completed is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.
So the minimum time needed for all buses to complete at least 5 trips is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: time = [2], totalTrips = 1
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is only one bus, and it will complete its first trip at t = 2.
So the minimum time needed to complete 1 trip is 2.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= time.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= time[i], totalTrips <= 10^7`

**题目**：给你一个数组 `time` ，其中 `time[i]` 表示第 `i` 辆公交车完成 **一趟****旅途**所需要花费的时间。每辆公交车可以**连续**完成多趟旅途，也就是说，一辆公交车当前旅途完成后，可以**立马开始**下一趟旅途。每辆公交车**独立**运行，也就是说可以同时有多辆公交车在运行且互不影响。给你一个整数 `totalTrips` ，表示所有公交车**总共**需要完成的旅途数目。请你返回完成**至少**`totalTrips` 趟旅途需要花费的**最少** 时间。

**思路**：二分查找。计算`t`时间内能够完成多少趟旅途，由限制条件可知，最坏的情况就是只有一辆车，对应的`time`为`10^7`、`totalTrips`为`10^7`，此时需要花费的时间为`10^14`，这个为花费时间的上限，依次进行二分查找。更多二分查找题目，参考[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-complete-trips/discuss/1802416/C++or-Answer-on-Binary-Search-or-List-of-Related-Problems)。

        while(l < r){
            long long mid = l + (r -l)/2;
            long long cur = 0;
            for(int t : time)
                cur += mid / t;
            if(cur < totalTrips)
                l = mid + 1;
            else
                r = mid;
        }
        return l;
    }
};
