# [1705. Maximum Number of Eaten Apples](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-eaten-apples/)

There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for `n` days. On the `ith` day, the tree grows `apples[i]` apples that will rot after `days[i]` days, that is on day `i + days[i]` the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by `apples[i] == 0` and `days[i] == 0`.

You decided to eat **at most** one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). Note that you can keep eating after the first `n` days.

Given two integer arrays `days` and `apples` of length `n`, return *the maximum number of apples you can eat.*

**Example 1:**

```
Input: apples = [1,2,3,5,2], days = [3,2,1,4,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: You can eat 7 apples:
- On the first day, you eat an apple that grew on the first day.
- On the second day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day.
- On the third day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day. After this day, the apples that grew on the third day rot.
- On the fourth to the seventh days, you eat apples that grew on the fourth day.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: apples = [3,0,0,0,0,2], days = [3,0,0,0,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can eat 5 apples:
- On the first to the third day you eat apples that grew on the first day.
- Do nothing on the fouth and fifth days.
- On the sixth and seventh days you eat apples that grew on the sixth day.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == apples.length == days.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
- `0 <= apples[i], days[i] <= 2 * 10^4`
- `days[i] = 0` if and only if `apples[i] = 0`.

**题目**：有一棵特殊的苹果树，一连 `n` 天，每天都可以长出若干个苹果。在第 `i` 天，树上会长出 `apples[i]` 个苹果，这些苹果将会在 `days[i]` 天后（也就是说，第 `i + days[i]` 天时）腐烂，变得无法食用。也可能有那么几天，树上不会长出新的苹果，此时用 `apples[i] == 0` 且 `days[i] == 0` 表示。你打算每天 **最多** 吃一个苹果来保证营养均衡。注意，你可以在这 `n` 天之后继续吃苹果。给你两个长度为 `n` 的整数数组 `days` 和 `apples` ，返回你可以吃掉的苹果的最大数目。

**思路**：优先队列。第`i`天优先吃快坏的那个苹果。

class Solution {
public:
    int eatenApples(vector<int>& apples, vector<int>& days) {
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>,
            greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;

        const int n = days.size();
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n || !pq.empty(); ++i){
            if(i < n)
                pq.push({i + days[i], apples[i]});

            while(!pq.empty() && pq.top().first <= i)
                pq.pop();

            if(!pq.empty()){
                res += 1;
                pair<int, int> cur = pq.top();
                pq.pop();
                if(--cur.second > 0)
                    pq.push(cur);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
