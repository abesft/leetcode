# [2311. Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-binary-subsequence-less-than-or-equal-to-k/)

You are given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `k`.

Return *the length of the **longest** subsequence of* `s` *that makes up a **binary** number less than or equal to* `k`.

Note:

- The subsequence can contain **leading zeroes**.
- The empty string is considered to be equal to `0`.
- A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "1001010", k = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 5 is "00010", as this number is equal to 2 in decimal.
Note that "00100" and "00101" are also possible, which are equal to 4 and 5 in decimal, respectively.
The length of this subsequence is 5, so 5 is returned.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "00101001", k = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: "000001" is the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 1, as this number is equal to 1 in decimal.
The length of this subsequence is 6, so 6 is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`

-----

**题目**：给你一个二进制字符串 `s` 和一个正整数 `k` 。 请你返回 `s` 的 **最长** 子序列，且该子序列对应的 **二进制** 数字小于等于 `k` 。注意：子序列可以有 **前导 0** 。空字符串视为 `0` 。**子序列** 是指从一个字符串中删除零个或者多个字符后，不改变顺序得到的剩余字符序列。

**思路**：贪心，参考[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-binary-subsequence-less-than-or-equal-to-k/discuss/2168423/O(n))。先保留下所有的`0`，然后尽可能多的保留下字符`1`。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubsequence(string s, int k) {
        int val = 0, cnt = 0, pow = 1;
        for(int i = s.size()-1; i >= 0 && val + pow <= k; --i){
            if(s[i] == '1'){
                cnt += 1;
                val += pow;
            }
            pow <<= 1;
        }
        return count(s.begin(), s.end(), '0') + cnt;
    }
};
