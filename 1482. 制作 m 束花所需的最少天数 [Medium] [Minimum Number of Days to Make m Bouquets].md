# [1482. Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-days-to-make-m-bouquets/)

You are given an integer array `bloomDay`, an integer `m` and an integer `k`.

You want to make `m` bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use `k` **adjacent flowers** from the garden.

The garden consists of `n` flowers, the `ith` flower will bloom in the `bloomDay[i]` and then can be used in **exactly one** bouquet.

Return *the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make* `m` *bouquets from the garden*. If it is impossible to make m bouquets return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: Let us see what happened in the first three days. x means flower bloomed and _ means flower did not bloom in the garden.
We need 3 bouquets each should contain 1 flower.
After day 1: [x, _, _, _, _]   // we can only make one bouquet.
After day 2: [x, _, _, _, x]   // we can only make two bouquets.
After day 3: [x, _, x, _, x]   // we can make 3 bouquets. The answer is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: We need 3 bouquets each has 2 flowers, that means we need 6 flowers. We only have 5 flowers so it is impossible to get the needed bouquets and we return -1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: bloomDay = [7,7,7,7,12,7,7], m = 2, k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: We need 2 bouquets each should have 3 flowers.
Here is the garden after the 7 and 12 days:
After day 7: [x, x, x, x, _, x, x]
We can make one bouquet of the first three flowers that bloomed. We cannot make another bouquet from the last three flowers that bloomed because they are not adjacent.
After day 12: [x, x, x, x, x, x, x]
It is obvious that we can make two bouquets in different ways.
```

**Constraints:**

- `bloomDay.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= bloomDay[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= m <= 10^6`
- `1 <= k <= n`

-----

**题目**：给你一个整数数组 `bloomDay`，以及两个整数 `m` 和 `k` 。现需要制作 `m` 束花。制作花束时，需要使用花园中 **相邻的 `k` 朵花** 。花园中有 `n` 朵花，第 `i` 朵花会在 `bloomDay[i]` 时盛开，**恰好** 可以用于 **一束** 花中。请你返回从花园中摘 `m` 束花需要等待的最少的天数。如果不能摘到 `m` 束花则返回 **-1** 。

**思路**：二分查找，参考[lee215](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-days-to-make-m-bouquets/discuss/686316/JavaC++Python-Binary-Search)。计算第`mid`天能够制作的花束数`bq`，如果`bq`小于目标值，说明还需要等待更多的花开，否则说明只需要更少的天数即可满足条件。
