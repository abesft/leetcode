# [1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended-ii/)

You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]`. The `ith` event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. You are also given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.

You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the **entire** event. Note that the end day is **inclusive**: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.

Return *the **maximum sum** of values that you can receive by attending events.*

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/10/screenshot-2021-01-11-at-60048-pm.png)

```
Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1]], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Choose the green events, 0 and 1 (0-indexed) for a total value of 4 + 3 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/10/screenshot-2021-01-11-at-60150-pm.png)

```
Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,10]], k = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: Choose event 2 for a total value of 10.
Notice that you cannot attend any other event as they overlap, and that you do not have to attend k events.
```

**Example 3:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/10/screenshot-2021-01-11-at-60703-pm.png)**

```
Input: events = [[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3],[4,4,4]], k = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: Although the events do not overlap, you can only attend 3 events. Pick the highest valued three.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= events.length`
- `1 <= k * events.length <= 10^6`
- `1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 10^9`
- `1 <= valuei <= 10^6`

-----

**题目**：给你一个 `events` 数组，其中 `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]` ，表示第 `i` 个会议在 `startDayi` 天开始，第 `endDayi` 天结束，如果你参加这个会议，你能得到价价值 `valuei` 。同时给你一个整数 `k` 表示你能参加的最多会议数目。你同一时间只能参加一个会议。如果你选择参加某个会议，那么你必须 **完整** 地参加完这个会议。会议结束日期是包含在会议内的，也就是说你不能同时参加一个开始日期与另一个结束日期相同的两个会议。请你返回能得到的会议价值 **最大和** 。

**思路**：参考[lee215](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended-ii/discuss/1052581/Python-DP/1051389)。每次只取一个会议，重复`k`次。类似[1235. Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-in-job-scheduling/)。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxValue(vector<vector<int>>& events, int k) {
        sort(events.begin(), events.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b){
            return a[1] < b[1];
        });
        map<int, int> mp1 = {{0, 0}}, mp2 = {{0, 0}};
        for(int t = 0; t < k; ++t){
            for(auto& vec : events){
                int cur = prev(mp1.lower_bound(vec[0]))->second + vec[2];
                if(cur > mp2.rbegin()->second)
                    mp2[vec[1]] = cur;
            }
            mp1 = mp2;
            mp2 = {{0, 0}};
        }
        return mp1.rbegin()->second;
    }
};
```
