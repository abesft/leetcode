# [2208. Minimum Operations to Halve Array Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-halve-array-sum/)

You are given an array `nums` of positive integers. In one operation, you can choose **any** number from `nums` and reduce it to **exactly** half the number. (Note that you may choose this reduced number in future operations.)

Return *the **minimum** number of operations to reduce the sum of* `nums` *by **at least** half.*

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [5,19,8,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The initial sum of nums is equal to 5 + 19 + 8 + 1 = 33.
The following is one of the ways to reduce the sum by at least half:
Pick the number 19 and reduce it to 9.5.
Pick the number 9.5 and reduce it to 4.75.
Pick the number 8 and reduce it to 4.
The final array is [5, 4.75, 4, 1] with a total sum of 5 + 4.75 + 4 + 1 = 14.75.
The sum of nums has been reduced by 33 - 14.75 = 18.25, which is at least half of the initial sum, 18.25 >= 33/2 = 16.5.
Overall, 3 operations were used so we return 3.
It can be shown that we cannot reduce the sum by at least half in less than 3 operations.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,8,20]
Output: 3
Explanation: The initial sum of nums is equal to 3 + 8 + 20 = 31.
The following is one of the ways to reduce the sum by at least half:
Pick the number 20 and reduce it to 10.
Pick the number 10 and reduce it to 5.
Pick the number 3 and reduce it to 1.5.
The final array is [1.5, 8, 5] with a total sum of 1.5 + 8 + 5 = 14.5.
The sum of nums has been reduced by 31 - 14.5 = 16.5, which is at least half of the initial sum, 16.5 >= 31/2 = 16.5.
Overall, 3 operations were used so we return 3.
It can be shown that we cannot reduce the sum by at least half in less than 3 operations.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^7`

-----

**题目**：给你一个正整数数组 `nums` 。每一次操作中，你可以从 `nums` 中选择 **任意** 一个数并将它减小到 **恰好** 一半。（注意，在后续操作中你可以对减半过的数继续执行操作）请你返回将 `nums` 数组和 **至少** 减少一半的 **最少** 操作数。

**思路**：优先队列。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int halveArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        double sum = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0.0);
        int res = 0;
        double t = 0;
        priority_queue<double> pq(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        while(t < sum / 2){
            double num = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            t += num / 2;
            pq.push(num/2);
            res += 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
