# [1488. Avoid Flood in The City](https://leetcode.com/problems/avoid-flood-in-the-city/)

Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the `nth` lake, the `nth` lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake which is **full of water**, there will be a **flood**. Your goal is to avoid the flood in any lake.

Given an integer array `rains` where:

* `rains[i] > 0` means there will be rains over the `rains[i]` lake.
* `rains[i] == 0` means there are no rains this day and you can choose **one lake** this day and **dry it**.

Return *an array `ans` * where:

* `ans.length == rains.length`
* `ans[i] == -1` if `rains[i] > 0`.
* `ans[i]` is the lake you choose to dry in the `ith` day if `rains[i] == 0`.

If there are multiple valid answers return **any** of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return **an empty array**.

Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes. (see example 4)

**Example 1:**

```
Input: rains = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day full lakes are [1,2,3]
After the fourth day full lakes are [1,2,3,4]
There's no day to dry any lake and there is no flood in any lake.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: rains = [1,2,0,0,2,1]
Output: [-1,-1,2,1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day, we dry lake 2. Full lakes are [1]
After the fourth day, we dry lake 1. There is no full lakes.
After the fifth day, full lakes are [2].
After the sixth day, full lakes are [1,2].
It is easy that this scenario is flood-free. [-1,-1,1,2,-1,-1] is another acceptable scenario.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: rains = [1,2,0,1,2]
Output: []
Explanation: After the second day, full lakes are  [1,2]. We have to dry one lake in the third day.
After that, it will rain over lakes [1,2]. It's easy to prove that no matter which lake you choose to dry in the 3rd day, the other one will flood.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: rains = [69,0,0,0,69]
Output: [-1,69,1,1,-1]
Explanation: Any solution on one of the forms [-1,69,x,y,-1], [-1,x,69,y,-1] or [-1,x,y,69,-1] is acceptable where 1 <= x,y <= 10^9
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: rains = [10,20,20]
Output: []
Explanation: It will rain over lake 20 two consecutive days. There is no chance to dry any lake.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= rains.length <= 10^5`
* `0 <= rains[i] <= 10^9`

-----

**题目**：你的国家有无数个湖泊，所有湖泊一开始都是空的。当第 `n` 个湖泊下雨的时候，如果第 `n` 个湖泊是空的，那么它就会装满水，否则这个湖泊会发生洪水。你的目标是避免任意一个湖泊发生洪水。给你一个整数数组 `rains` ，其中：

* `rains[i] > 0` 表示第 `i` 天时，第 `rains[i]` 个湖泊会下雨。

* `rains[i] == 0` 表示第 `i` 天没有湖泊会下雨，你可以选择 **一个** 湖泊并 **抽干** 这个湖泊的水。

请返回一个数组 `ans` ，满足：

* `ans.length == rains.length`

* 如果 `rains[i] > 0` ，那么`ans[i] == -1` 。

* 如果 `rains[i] == 0` ，`ans[i]` 是你第 `i` 天选择抽干的湖泊。

如果有多种可行解，请返回它们中的 **任意一个** 。如果没办法阻止洪水，请返回一个 **空的数组** 。

请注意，如果你选择抽干一个装满水的湖泊，它会变成一个空的湖泊。但如果你选择抽干一个空的湖泊，那么将无事发生（详情请看示例 4）。

**思路**：参考[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/avoid-flood-in-the-city/discuss/697687/A-Set-and-A-Map-Lucid-code-with-documented-comments.)。假设是在第i天，lake装满水；如果要抽干这个lake，则必须选择第i天之后的某一个无雨天进行抽干。因此需记录每个lake是在第几天装满水的。

public:
    vector<int> avoidFlood(vector<int>& rains) {
        int n = rains.size();
        // full <lake_idx: full_of_water_day>
        map<int, int> full;
        set<int> drydays;
        vector<int> res(n);

        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            int lake = rains[i];
            if(lake == 0){
                drydays.insert(i);
                res[i] = 1;
                continue;
            }

            if(full.find(lake) != full.end()){
                int rainyday = full[lake];
                // lake在rainday被装满水，只能在rainday之后选择无雨的一天进行抽干
                auto iter = drydays.upper_bound(rainyday);
                if(iter == drydays.end()){
                    return {};
                }
                // 在第*iter无雨天对lake进行干燥
                res[*iter] = lake;
                drydays.erase(*iter);
            }
            res[i] = -1;
            full[lake] = i;
        }

        return res;
    }
};
