# [2141. Maximum Running Time of N Computers](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-running-time-of-n-computers/)

You have `n` computers. You are given the integer `n` and a **0-indexed** integer array `batteries` where the `ith` battery can **run** a computer for `batteries[i]` minutes. You are interested in running **all** `n` computers **simultaneously** using the given batteries.

Initially, you can insert **at most one battery** into each computer. After that and at any integer time moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery **any number of times**. The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another computer. You may assume that the removing and inserting processes take no time.

Note that the batteries cannot be recharged.

Return *the **maximum** number of minutes you can run all the* `n` *computers simultaneously.*

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2, batteries = [3,3,3]
Output: 4
Explanation:
Initially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 1 into the second computer.
After two minutes, remove battery 1 from the second computer and insert battery 2 instead. Note that battery 1 can still run for one minute.
At the end of the third minute, battery 0 is drained, and you need to remove it from the first computer and insert battery 1 instead.
By the end of the fourth minute, battery 1 is also drained, and the first computer is no longer running.
We can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 4 minutes, so we return 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2, batteries = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Initially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 2 into the second computer.
After one minute, battery 0 and battery 2 are drained so you need to remove them and insert battery 1 into the first computer and battery 3 into the second computer.
After another minute, battery 1 and battery 3 are also drained so the first and second computers are no longer running.
We can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 2 minutes, so we return 2.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= batteries.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= batteries[i] <= 10^9`

-----

**题目**：你有 `n` 台电脑。给你整数 `n` 和一个下标从 **0** 开始的整数数组 `batteries` ，其中第 `i` 个电池可以让一台电脑 **运行** `batteries[i]` 分钟。你想使用这些电池让 **全部** `n` 台电脑 **同时** 运行。一开始，你可以给每台电脑连接 **至多一个电池** 。然后在任意整数时刻，你都可以将一台电脑与它的电池断开连接，并连接另一个电池，你可以进行这个操作 **任意次** 。新连接的电池可以是一个全新的电池，也可以是别的电脑用过的电池。断开连接和连接新的电池不会花费任何时间。注意，你不能给电池充电。请你返回你可以让 `n` 台电脑同时运行的 **最长** 分钟数。

**思路**：参考[lee215](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-running-time-of-n-computers/discuss/1692939/JavaC++Python-Sort-Solution-with-Explanation-O(mlogm))。`sum(batteries)/n`是能够运行分钟数的上限`t`。如果`max(batteries) < t`，则通过各电池的配合能运行到上限时间。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxRunTime(int n, vector<int>& batteries) {
        long long sum = accumulate(batteries.begin(), batteries.end(), 0L);
        sort(batteries.begin(), batteries.end());
        const int m = batteries.size();
        int k = 0;
        while(batteries[m-1-k] > sum / (n-k))
            sum -= batteries[m-1-k++];
        return sum / (n-k);
    }
};
```
