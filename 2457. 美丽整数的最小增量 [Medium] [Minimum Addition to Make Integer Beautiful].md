# [2457. Minimum Addition to Make Integer Beautiful](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-addition-to-make-integer-beautiful/)

You are given two positive integers `n` and `target`.

An integer is considered **beautiful** if the sum of its digits is less than or equal to `target`.

Return the *minimum **non-negative** integer* `x` *such that* `n + x` *is beautiful*. The input will be generated such that it is always possible to make `n` beautiful.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 16, target = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: Initially n is 16 and its digit sum is 1 + 6 = 7. After adding 4, n becomes 20 and digit sum becomes 2 + 0 = 2. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 467, target = 6
Output: 33
Explanation: Initially n is 467 and its digit sum is 4 + 6 + 7 = 17. After adding 33, n becomes 500 and digit sum becomes 5 + 0 + 0 = 5. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 33.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 1, target = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: Initially n is 1 and its digit sum is 1, which is already smaller than or equal to target.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^12`
- `1 <= target <= 150`
- The input will be generated such that it is always possible to make `n` beautiful.

**题目**：给你两个正整数 `n` 和 `target` 。如果某个整数每一位上的数字相加小于或等于 `target` ，则认为这个整数是一个 **美丽整数** 。找出并返回满足 `n + x` 是 **美丽整数** 的最小非负整数 `x` 。生成的输入保证总可以使 `n` 变成一个美丽整数。

**思路**：参考[lee215](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-addition-to-make-integer-beautiful/discuss/2758216/JavaC++Python-Straight-Forward-Solution)。如果当前`n`每一位上的数字相加大于`target`，说明要产生进位才有可能使得整体的数字和变小。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long makeIntegerBeautiful(long long n, int target) {
        long long n0 = n, base = 1;
        while(target < sum(n)){
            n = n / 10 + 1;
            base *= 10;
        }
        return base * n - n0;
    }

    int sum(long long n){
        int res = 0;
        while(n){
            res += n % 10;
            n /= 10;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
