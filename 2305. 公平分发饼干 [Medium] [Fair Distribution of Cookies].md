# [2305. Fair Distribution of Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/fair-distribution-of-cookies/)

You are given an integer array `cookies`, where `cookies[i]` denotes the number of cookies in the `ith` bag. You are also given an integer `k` that denotes the number of children to distribute **all** the bags of cookies to. All the cookies in the same bag must go to the same child and cannot be split up.

The **unfairness** of a distribution is defined as the **maximum** **total** cookies obtained by a single child in the distribution.

Return *the **minimum** unfairness of all distributions*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: cookies = [8,15,10,20,8], k = 2
Output: 31
Explanation: One optimal distribution is [8,15,8] and [10,20]
- The 1st child receives [8,15,8] which has a total of 8 + 15 + 8 = 31 cookies.
- The 2nd child receives [10,20] which has a total of 10 + 20 = 30 cookies.
The unfairness of the distribution is max(31,30) = 31.
It can be shown that there is no distribution with an unfairness less than 31.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: cookies = [6,1,3,2,2,4,1,2], k = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: One optimal distribution is [6,1], [3,2,2], and [4,1,2]
- The 1st child receives [6,1] which has a total of 6 + 1 = 7 cookies.
- The 2nd child receives [3,2,2] which has a total of 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 cookies.
- The 3rd child receives [4,1,2] which has a total of 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 cookies.
The unfairness of the distribution is max(7,7,7) = 7.
It can be shown that there is no distribution with an unfairness less than 7.
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= cookies.length <= 8`
- `1 <= cookies[i] <= 10^5`
- `2 <= k <= cookies.length`

-----

**题目**：给你一个整数数组 `cookies` ，其中 `cookies[i]` 表示在第 `i` 个零食包中的饼干数量。另给你一个整数 `k` 表示等待分发零食包的孩子数量，**所有** 零食包都需要分发。在同一个零食包中的所有饼干都必须分发给同一个孩子，不能分开。分发的 **不公平程度** 定义为单个孩子在分发过程中能够获得饼干的最大总数。返回所有分发的最小不公平程度。

**思路**：DFS，将`cookies[i]`分别发给各孩子，遍历所有可能的分组情况。注意与[410. Split Array Largest Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-largest-sum/)的区别。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int distributeCookies(vector<int>& cookies, int k) {
        vector<int> val(k, 0);
        int res = INT_MAX;
        helper(cookies, val, 0, res);
        return res;
    }
private:
    void helper(const vector<int>& cookies, vector<int>& val, int i, int& res){
        if(i == cookies.size()){
            res = min(res, *max_element(val.begin(), val.end()));
            return;
        }

        for(int j = 0; j < val.size(); ++j){
            val[j] += cookies[i];
            helper(cookies, val, i + 1, res);
            val[j] -= cookies[i];
        }
        return;
    }
};
```
