# [2320. Count Number of Ways to Place Houses](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-ways-to-place-houses/)

There is a street with `n * 2` **plots**, where there are `n` plots on each side of the street. The plots on each side are numbered from `1` to `n`. On each plot, a house can be placed.

Return *the number of ways houses can be placed such that no two houses are adjacent to each other on the same side of the street*. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

Note that if a house is placed on the `ith` plot on one side of the street, a house can also be placed on the `ith` plot on the other side of the street.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
Possible arrangements:
1. All plots are empty.
2. A house is placed on one side of the street.
3. A house is placed on the other side of the street.
4. Two houses are placed, one on each side of the street.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 9
Explanation: The 9 possible arrangements are shown in the diagram above.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^4`

-----

**题目**：一条街道上共有 `n * 2` 个 **地块** ，街道的两侧各有 `n` 个地块。每一边的地块都按从 `1` 到 `n` 编号。每个地块上都可以放置一所房子。现要求街道同一侧不能存在两所房子相邻的情况，请你计算并返回放置房屋的方式数目。由于答案可能很大，需要对 `10^9 + 7` 取余后再返回。注意，如果一所房子放置在这条街某一侧上的第 `i` 个地块，不影响在另一侧的第 `i` 个地块放置房子。

**思路**：DP，参考[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-ways-to-place-houses/discuss/2198118/Easy-C++-with-explanation-or-DP)。先计算一边的斐波那契数列。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countHousePlacements(int n) {
        long mod = 1e9 + 7;
        long house = 1, space = 1;
        long total = house + space;
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; ++i){
            house = space;
            space = total;
            total = (house + space) % mod;
        }
        return (total * total) % mod;
    }
};
```
