# [1760. Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-limit-of-balls-in-a-bag/)

You are given an integer array `nums` where the `ith` bag contains `nums[i]` balls. You are also given an integer `maxOperations`.

You can perform the following operation at most `maxOperations` times:

- Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.

  - For example, a bag of `5` balls can become two new bags of `1` and `4` balls, or two new bags of `2` and `3` balls.

Your penalty is the **maximum** number of balls in a bag. You want to **minimize** your penalty after the operations.

Return *the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
- Divide the bag with 9 balls into two bags of sizes 6 and 3. [9] -> [6,3].
- Divide the bag with 6 balls into two bags of sizes 3 and 3. [6,3] -> [3,3,3].
The bag with the most number of balls has 3 balls, so your penalty is 3 and you should return 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,4,8,2], maxOperations = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Divide the bag with 8 balls into two bags of sizes 4 and 4. [2,4,8,2] -> [2,4,4,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,4,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,4,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,2,2,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].
The bag with the most number of balls has 2 balls, so your penalty is 2 an you should return 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [7,17], maxOperations = 2
Output: 7
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= maxOperations, nums[i] <= 10^9`

**题目**：给你一个整数数组 `nums` ，其中 `nums[i]` 表示第 `i` 个袋子里球的数目。同时给你一个整数 `maxOperations` 。你可以进行如下操作至多 `maxOperations` 次：选择任意一个袋子，并将袋子里的球分到 2 个新的袋子中，每个袋子里都有 **正整数** 个球。比方说，一个袋子里有 `5` 个球，你可以把它们分到两个新袋子里，分别有 `1` 个和 `4` 个球，或者分别有 `2` 个和 `3` 个球。你的开销是单个袋子里球数目的 **最大值** ，你想要 **最小化** 开销。请你返回进行上述操作后的最小开销。

**思路**：二分查找。假设我们已经找到了最小开销为`res`，那么对于某个袋子的球`num`，被分至`n`个新袋子，均满足个数小于等于`res`，其所需的拆分操作数为`cnt=(num-1)/res`。判断所有的操作数是否超过了`maxOperations`，依此来调整`res`。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumSize(vector<int>& nums, int maxOperations) {
        int l = 1, r = 1e9;
        while(l < r){
            int mid = l + (r - l)/2;
            int cnt = 0;
            for(int num : nums){
                cnt += (num - 1) / mid;
            }
            if(cnt > maxOperations)
                l = mid + 1;
            else
                r = mid;
        }
        return l;
    }
};
```
